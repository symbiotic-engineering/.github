# Welcome to the Symbiotic Engineering and Analysis (SEA) Lab's GitHub page!
The [SEA Lab](https://sea.mae.cornell.edu) develops interdisciplinary symbiotic solutions to advance sustainable offshore technologies vital to the growth of the Blue Economy* and the mitigation of climate change. The SEA Lab is led by [Professor Maha Haji](https://www.mae.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/maha-haji) in the [Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.mae.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu/).

*The Blue Economy is defined by the United Nations as an ocean economy that aims at “the improvement of human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities” ([UN, 2014, p.2](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/2978BEconcept.pdf))
